READ ME: For the teacher

This application was developed using vs code on macOS. To run the app, run "npm start" in the root directory and in the "client" directory.
Multiple issues were faced during the development of this app, which resulted in the absence of a couple of requirements. These are:
- Pagination when loading the tasks
- Even thought the app features statistics, there are no graphs. I had to focus more on the overall functionality of the app rather than being stuck on something that is more or less not important.

Other than that, I think the app turned out alright. I used bootstrap for general styling, as I was already familiar with it. The app runs locally on port 5001.
